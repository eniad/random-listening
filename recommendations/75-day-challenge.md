> Here's a thing I'm doing to start some discussions! 75 days of discussing albums is going to be fun so lets start this out with an easy question. What album do you never get tired listening to. Mine is going have to be Ok Computer by Radiohead! - u/Rambooctpuss, [13 March, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/albumbucketlist/comments/11qegfy/75_day_album_challenge_day_1_what_album_do_you/)

u/eniadcorlet scrapped, cleaned, and deduplicated the comments from all 75 days to get a single list of albums with number of days commented counts and the days the album was commented.

## Methods

u/eniadcorlet scrapped, cleaned, and deduplicated the comments from all 75 days to get a single list of albums with number of days commented counts and the days the album was commented.

- Couting - Albums were counted, once per day. In other words, multiple metions on a single day only counted as one.
- Guesses - Some albums were ambiguous. Any interpretation errors are my own.
- Tools - VS Code (text editing), Google Sheets (spreadsheeting)

## Observations

The most popular days were the four days of What's Your Favorite [insert decade] Album? for the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10 (in that order). I didn't find any posts for days 3, 10, or 50. Only one person who likes Maggot Brain wanted to talk about altered states of mind (day 17).

We like talking about Dylan, Bowie, the Beatles, and... The Prodigy? There are 6 other artists with 6 mentions, but the top 25 felt right. (removed Various Artists)

The albums commented 4 days or more. Ziggy Stardust was the most commented album. The only surprise here is Blind Melon and maybe Boston. (Removed Greatest Hits and any)
