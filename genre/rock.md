# Rock

* The Rolling Stones
  * [x] The Rolling Stones - The Rolling Stones (1964). I think of the Stones as an 80s band because of their staying power. This is arguably as important as any Beatles album.
  * [ ] The Rolling Stones - Beggar's Banquet (1968).
  * [x] The Rolling Stones - Let It Bleed (1969). Such a slinky sound. The best Stones album.
  * [ ] The Rolling Stones - Sticky Fingers (1971).
* [ ] Paul McCartney/Wings - Band On The Run (1973).
* Thin Lizzy
  * [x] Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak. They're back. Great, fun rock.
  * [x] Thin Lizzy - Live and Dangerous. Live albums sometimes sound canned. This one is no exception. But the songs and enthusiasm push through.
* AC/DC
  * [x] AC/DC - Power Up. Best of 2020 list. What year is it? Don't ever change, AC/DC. You do one song and you do it great.
  * [ ] AC/DC - Powerage. (1978) For Riff Raff.
* Kiss
  * [x] Kiss - Kiss. The rock is so straight forward that they needed makeup to make them stand out. Still fun.
  * [x] Kiss - Kiss Alive!
* The Who
  * [x] The Who - Who's Next (1971). I don't love all Who albums, but I love this one.
  * [ ] The Who - Live At Leeds (1970).
* Queen.
  * [x] Queen - _Queen II_. Popular prog rock is still prog rock. But weirdly, I'm more familiar with the cover of this album than it's contents.
  * [x] Queen - Queen. There is a lot going on here; it constantly surprised me. Queen is a band of virtuosos. I hadn't heard this album. It's nice to visit a place that's familiar yet previously undiscovered.
  * [ ] Queen - _Flash Gordon_.
* [ ] Weird Al.
