# The Beatles

* [x] The Beatles - A Hard Day's Night (1964). This is the Beatles at their most fun. (200 Greatest Rock Albums)
* [x] The Beatles - Rubber Soul (1965). Still bubble gum pop, but drifting to the psychedelic. Maybe it's nostalgia, but this album feels so comfortable. (200 Greatest Rock Albums)
* [x] The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). I don't think this to is even the greatest Beatles album. I suppose it opened the door for a lot of experimental music. It's great, just not the greatest. (#1 on 200 Greatest Rock Albums)
* [x] The Beatles - The Beatles (The White Album) (1968). This is prog rock done by the Beatles. They were brilliant and exhausted at this point in their career as a band. (200 Greatest Rock Albums)
* [ ] The Beatles - Let it Be.
* [ ] The Beatles - Revolver.
